# 3D Reconstruction Project with Gaussian Splatting + COLMAP + Brush

This project integrates multiple computer vision and rendering tools to create an automated 3D reconstruction pipeline, combining:

- [**UnityGaussianSplatting**](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting) – Aras Pranckevičius Unity Gaussian Splatting project (main base project, Unity-compatible)
- [**COLMAP**](https://colmap.github.io/) – a general-purpose Structure-from-Motion (SfM) tool
- [**Brush**](https://github.com/your-brush-repo) – a 3D reconstruction engine using Gaussian Splatting
- **Custom pipeline** developed within this repository

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Automate the pipeline: user provides images → system generates 3D reconstruction.
- Integrate COLMAP and Brush into UnityGaussianSplatting.
- Enable use in future applications (e.g., BIM analysis, immersive environments, etc.).
